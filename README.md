# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an 18-year-old full-stack developer with a passion for building innovative applications and exploring new technologies. I'm most comfortable with Rust, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Java, and I enjoy using these languages to build robust, scalable software.

In particular, I love Rust ðŸ¦€ for its performance and safety guarantees, and TypeScript for its strong typing and ease of use. I also have experience with the following languages, but generally don't enjoy working with them:

- C++
- C#
- Python
- Lua
- PHP
- Go

I enjoy creating Minecraft mods and Fivem/Cfx scripts. I'm also looking forward to the release of Hytale and hope to become a modder for that game as well!

## Projects
